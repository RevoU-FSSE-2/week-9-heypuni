# Welcome to my revou's 9th week project!

A little bit late (ok, a lot late) but here it is!
This week, I created 2 tables in mysql, one for the users and one for the posts. Connected the two fo them with a foreign key and created a simple mbanking app to display the user's total balance and total expenses.    

Here's the [link](https://mbanking-app-cecw.vercel.app) to the project!
